## Game Logic ðŸŽ´

The game checks to see if the hand is any of the below from top to bottom

### Royal Flush

- Sort the hand's face values array
- Make a set of the hands suits
- Check if the hand's face values are a royal straight (10, J, Q, K, A)
- Check if the set only has one suit
- If both of those cases are true then the hand is a royal flush
